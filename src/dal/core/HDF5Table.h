      <li>HDF5 User's guide, Section 2.7,  Creating and defining compound
      datatypes
    </ul>

    A composite datatype is an aggregation of one or more datatypes. Each class
    of composite datatypes a properties that describe the organization of the 
    composite datatype. Composite datatypes include:
    - Compound datatypes: structured records
    - Array: a multidimensional array of a datatype.
    - Variable length: a one-dimensional array of a datatype
    
    An HDF5 compound datatype is similar to a C struct or a Fortran common block.
    Though not originally designed with databases in mind, HDF5 compound
    datatypes are sometimes used in a manner analogous to a database record.

    HDF5 defines a compound datatype as a collection of one or more data elements.
    Each elements is an atomic type, a small array, or another compound datatype.
    The provision for nested compound datatypes allows these structures become
    quite complex. Compound datatypes thus become either a powerful tool or a
    complex and difficult to debug construct; reasonable caution is advised.
    
    To create and use a compound datatype, you need to create a datatype with
    class compound (<tt>H5T_COMPOUND</tt>) and specify the total size of the
    data element in bytes. A compound datatype consists of zero or more uniquely
    named members. Members can be defined in any order but must occupy
    non-overlapping regions within the datum.

    - \b Index -- An index number between zero and N-1, where N is the number of
    members in the compound. The elements are indexed in the order of their
    location in the array of bytes.
    - \b Name -- A string that must be unique within the members of the same
    datatype.
    - \b Datatype -- An HDF5 datatype.
    - \b Offset -- A fixed byte offset, which defines the location of the first
    byte of that member in the compound datatype.

    Properties of the members of a compound datatype are defined when the member
    is added to the compound type and cannot be subsequently modified.
    
    <b>Defining compound datatypes.</b>

    Compound datatypes must be built out of other datatypes. First, one creates
    an empty compound datatype and specifies its total size. Members are then added
    to the compound datatype in any order. 
    
    Each member must have a descriptive name, which is the key used to uniquely
    identify the member within the compound datatype. A member name in an HDF5
    datatype does not necessarily have to be the same as the name of the
    corresponding member in the C struct in memory, although this is often the
    case. Nor does one need to define all members of the C struct in the HDF5
    compound datatype (or vice versa). 

    Usually a C struct will be defined to hold a data point in memory, and the
    offsets of the members in memory will be the offsets of the struct members
    from the beginning of an instance of the struct. The library defines the
    macro that computes the offset of member m within a struct variable
    <tt>s</tt>.:

    <h3>Synopsis</h3>
    
    A generic table is a sequence of records, each record has a name and a type.
    Table data is stored as an HDF5 one dimensional compound dataset. A table
    is defined as a collection of records whose values are stored in fixed-length
    fields. All records have the same structure and all values in each field have
    the same data type.
    
    The dataset for a table is distinguished from other datasets by giving it an
    attribute "CLASS=TABLE". Optional attributes allow the storage of a title for
    the Table and for each column, and a fill value for each column. 

    Encapsulated HDF5 library functions:

      attached to the object specified by the identifier \e loc_id.

      \endcode

      <li>\b H5TBread_fields_name reads the fields identified by \e field_names
      from a dataset named \e table_name attached to the object specified by the
      identifier \e loc_id.
      \code
